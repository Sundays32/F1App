    <h2>2023 Season</h2>
    <p>
      The 2023 Formula 1 season was a showcase of Red Bull Racing's dominance,
      with the team securing both the Constructors' Championship and driver Max
      Verstappen clinching the Drivers' Championship. Over the course of 23
      races from March to November, Red Bull Racing consistently outperformed
      its competitors, with Verstappen delivering a series of impressive
      victories that underscored his exceptional skill and the team's superior
      performance. While Ferrari, Mercedes, and McLaren fought hard, with
      notable podium finishes and race wins, they were unable to challenge Red
      Bull's overall pace and consistency. The season featured thrilling races
      and strategic battles at iconic circuits such as Monaco, Silverstone, and
      Suzuka, adding to the drama and excitement of the championship. Teams
      continued to innovate with technical developments, particularly in
      aerodynamics and power units, which played a crucial role in shaping the
      outcomes. As the season wrapped up, focus shifted to the future, with
      anticipation building for the next chapter in Formula 1, where teams and
      drivers will aim to build on their experiences and adapt to new
      challenges.
