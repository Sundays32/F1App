      <h3>Background Information</h3>
      <h5>
        Gene Haas established Haas F1 during the early part of Formula 1's
        turbo-hybrid era. Originally, Haas were set to make their debut in the
        pinnacle of motorsport in 2015, but this was postponed to the start of
        the 2016 F1 season.
      </h5>
      <p>
        Guenther Steiner has been Team Principal at Haas since the squad first
        arrived in the sport, and he is well-known for his charismatic,
        no-nonsense personality. Steiner became popular with many F1 fans thanks
        to his appearances on Netflix's Drive To Survive series, where he has
        often been heard to swear extensively.The team's headquarters are
        located in Kannapolis, North Carolina, in the United States, alongside
        sister team and NASCAR entrant Stewart-Haas Racing, though the two
        outfits are separate entities. Haas also have a forward base in Banbury,
        UK, for the purpose of turning cars around between races during the
        European part of the calendar, whilst their power units are supplied by
        Ferrari in Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Haas became the first American constructor to compete in F1 since the
        unrelated Haas Lola outfit raced in the 1985 and 1986 seasons. The 2016
        Australian Grand Prix saw Haas make their debut with drivers Romain
        Grosjean and Esteban Gutierrez, and it went brilliantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another remarkable result followed at the Bahrain Grand Prix, when
        Grosjean finished in fifth place. It was Haas' best result that year,
        and Grosjean scored all of the team's 29 points as Gutierrez struggled.
        Nevertheless, it was the best debut for a new Formula 1 team this
        century.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having finished eighth in the 2016 F1 Constructors' Championship, Haas
        repeated that feat with Grosjean and former McLaren and Renault driver
        Kevin Magnussen, who joined the team for the 2017 Formula 1 season.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2018 Formula 1 season saw Haas often at the front of the midfield
        battle, only behind Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull. It was nearly an
        incredible beginning to their campaign at that year's Australian Grand
        Prix.
      </p>
      <p>
        A fuel infringement and an illegal floor led to disqualifications in the
        United States and Italian Grands Prix respectively, which hampered Haas'
        chances to beat Renault in the Constructors' Championship. Nevertheless,
        the team ended the season in fifth, which remains their best F1 campaign
        to date.
      </p>
      <p>
        Haas had been on a high in 2018, but endured a tough season in 2019 as
        they struggled to find the optimal tyre working window throughout the
        year. The Australian Grand Prix went well for the team as Magnussen
        finished sixth, but that would be Haas' best result of the campaign.The
        off-track talk became the other big story for Haas as their title
        sponsor, Rich Energy, caused mayhem. Leading up to the British Grand
        Prix, the Rich Energy Twitter account announced that the sponsorship
        deal had been terminated, due to poor performances. This was denied by
        Haas and Rich Energy's shareholders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Magnussen and Grosjean both left Haas and Formula 1 at the end of 2020.
        The team instead opted to go for a bold rookie driver pairing for 2021
        in the form of Mick Schumacher and Nikita Mazepin.Even before the new
        season had begun, Haas admitted that they were using 2021 as a
        transitional year and were fully focused on 2022, when new technical
        regulations are introduced into F1.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2023 season did not go smoothly for the American F1 team. They
        finished last in the standings because the car was not competitive
        enough to contend for points. Haas faced numerous issues with tire wear,
        causing them to lose ground compared to their competitors. Following the
        conclusion of the 2023 season, the contract of team principal GÃ¼nther
        Steiner was not renewed due to disappointing performances. Ayao Komatsu
        will assume his role within the Haas F1 Team.
