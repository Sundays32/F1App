# F1App

This is an informative app on the sport of Formula 1, which contains the basic introduction to the sport. This is a passion project of mine, that I build and maintain in my free time taking information from sources freely available on the internet. Currently this website is still under development, and once the basic site is built, the information mentioned will be updated, and rewritten . For now, this information serves are a basic structure for the site. Ideally this site will be maintained and regularly updated, adding more information and features along the way.
